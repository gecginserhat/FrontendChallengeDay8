Day 8: Starting with JavaScript - The Journey Begins<br/>

🎯 Day 8 of my 21-day coding challenge, and today I dove into JavaScript, the language that brings web pages to life! 📝 This is where the magic of interactivity starts.<br/>

🔍 Here's what I accomplished:<br/>

- Introduction to JavaScript: I learned the basics, including how JavaScript integrates with HTML and CSS to create dynamic web pages. Understanding variables, data types, and basic syntax is the first step toward mastering this powerful language.<br/>
- Developer Tools & Console: I spent time exploring the browser’s developer tools and console. It’s amazing how these tools can help debug code, test scripts, and understand how the browser interprets JavaScript. This will be crucial as I start writing more complex scripts.<br/>
- Reviewing Previous Topics: To ensure a solid foundation, I revisited key concepts from the past week, like CSS, Flexbox, and Bootstrap. This review helped reinforce what I’ve learned and prepared me for integrating JavaScript with my existing projects.<br/>

🔥 JavaScript is unlocking new possibilities for interactivity in my web development journey. I’m excited to explore more advanced topics in the coming days!<br/>
